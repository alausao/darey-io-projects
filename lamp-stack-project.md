# Lamp Stack Implemetation

## Introduction

A “LAMP” stack is a group of open source software that is typically installed together in order to enable a server to host dynamic websites and web apps written in PHP. This term is an acronym which represents the **L**inux operating system with the **A**pache web server. The site data is stored in a **M**ySQL database, and dynamic content is processed by **P**HP.
