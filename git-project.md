# Git: A Version Control System

In this project we will begin by explaining some background on version control tools, then move on to how to get Git running on your system and finally how to get it set up to start working with. At the end of this project you should understand why Git is around, why you should use it and you should be all set up to do so.

üîß **Pre-requisites:**

- You must have some familiarity with Linux Commands
- Have GitBash installed on your system if you're using windows
- Must have created a GitHub/GitLab Account.
- If you're running Linux you can install git using the following options:

```bash
sudo apt install -y git # Ubuntu/Debian Linux

sudo yum install -y git # CentOS/Amazon Linux/RedHat

sudo dnf install -y git # Fedora
```
## About Version Control

What is ‚Äúversion control‚Äù, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. 

It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Repository (Repo)

A Git repository is a collection of files and their entire history of changes. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (hosted on a server). Repositories are the core of Git and contain all the project's files and their change history.

### 2. Commit

A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time. Each commit records changes to files, along with a unique identifier (hash), a commit message describing the changes, and a pointer to the previous commit, forming a commit history.

### 3. Branch

A branch is a separate line of development within a repository. It allows multiple contributors to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other. The default branch is usually called `master` or `main`.

### 4. Clone

Cloning a repository creates a local copy of a remote repository, allowing you to work on the project locally. This is the primary way to start contributing to a Git project.

## Certainly! Here are the commands used at each of the three Git states:

## The Three States

Pay attention now‚Äîhere is the main thing to remember about Git if you want the rest of your learning process to go smoothly. Git has three main states that your files can reside in:

1. **Modified** üìù: This means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
   
   Commands:
   - Modify a file.
   - Check the status: `git status`.

2. **Staged** üöß: This means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
   
   Commands:
   - Stage changes: `git add <file>`.
   - Check the status: `git status`.

3. **Committed** ‚úÖ: This means that the data is safely stored in your local database.
   
   Commands:
   - Commit changes: `git commit -m "Commit message"`.
   - Check commit history: `git log`.

This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project:

- **Working Tree** üå≥: The area where you modify files.
- **Staging Area** üì¶: Where you stage changes before committing.
- **Git Directory** üóÑÔ∏è: The local database where committed changes are stored.

üìù Remembering these states and commands is crucial for understanding Git's workflow and version control process.

## Basic Git Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Create a new Git repository or clone an existing one.
   ```bash
   git init  # Initialize a new repository
   git clone <repository-url>  # Clone an existing repository
   ```

2. **Add and Commit**: Stage changes and commit them to the repository.
   ```bash
   git add <file>  # Stage a file for commit
   git commit -m "Commit message"  # Commit staged changes
   ```

3. **Branching and Merging**:
   - Create a new branch: `git branch <branch-name>`
   - Switch to a branch: `git checkout <branch-name>`
   - Merge changes from one branch into another: `git merge <source-branch>`

4. **Remote Repositories**:
   - Add a remote: `git remote add <name> <repository-url>`
   - Pull changes from a remote: `git pull <remote> <branch>`
   - Push changes to a remote: `git push <remote> <branch>`

5. **History and Logs**:
   - View commit history: `git log`
   - View differences between commits: `git diff <commit1> <commit2>`
