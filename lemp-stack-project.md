# Web Stack Implementation (Lemp Stack)

## What is a LEMP Stack?

The Ubuntu LEMP stack serves as a substitute for the original [LAMP Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29). Both stacks consist of the Linux operating system, a web server, a database, and a programming/scripting language. Both stacks allow users to host web applications and implement a fully-functional programming environment. Additionally, the main components of both the LAMP and LEMP stacks can be installed using the default Ubuntu software repository.

The original LAMP Stack includes Linux, [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/), [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/), and [PHP](https://www.php.net/). The Ubuntu LEMP stack alternative continues to use Linux and PHP, but it includes the NGINX web server instead of Apache. In most cases, a LEMP stack uses the [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) database, although MySQL can also be used.
